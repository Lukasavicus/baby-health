## Risk & Mitigation by Epic

| Epic | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|-----------|
| EP-01 | Design delays block everything | Start design in parallel; use UI kit template; agile iteration |
| EP-02 | Schema changes late | Lock schema early; get stakeholder buy-in; use versioning |
| EP-03 | Metrics calculation wrong | Unit test all logic; manual verification; stakeholder review |
| EP-04 | Timer doesn't persist | Use service worker + state management; test thoroughly |
| EP-05 | Cross-midnight sleeps fail | Unit tests with dates spanning midnight; handle timezone |
| EP-06 | Activity timer drains battery | Test battery impact; update only when in foreground |
| EP-07 | No auth confuses users | Clear onboarding; device pairing explanation; future upgrade path |
| EP-08 | Insights too pushy | Tone review by non-technical person; user testing |
| EP-09 | Content outdated | Pediatrician review; update schedule; user feedback loop |
| EP-10 | Charts slow with many measurements | Optimize queries; virtualization; test on low-end device |
| EP-11 | Users confuse with medical advice | Clear disclaimer; no recommendations; informational only |
